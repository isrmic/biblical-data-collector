# biblical-data-collector
It is a simple data collector of biblical web data with the aim of generating data enough to create a simple API.

# first steps
    1- git clone https://github.com/isrmic/biblical-data-collector <name-folder>
    2- cd <name-folder>
    3- npm start
so we can see the progress of data collection (nothing very impressively).
the results will be stored in the books folder (each book is stored in separate files) and in the result folder (the unification of all collected data) in the format nvt.json.

# how to use the data ?
The data was collected from a website called Christian World, this project simply collects data from this site and stores in separate files each set of data from the collected books / letters and then unifies them into a single file. The data can be used according to what is allowed (for those who know more about laws, copyright etc ...) because in this project only a demonstration is made of how to collect data and how the data is specifically collected, it is not done commercial use or any kind of inappropriate use of the collected data, then for the people who use the project and explore how the collection is done, collect other data and even use the data in some way will be entirely their responsibility.
